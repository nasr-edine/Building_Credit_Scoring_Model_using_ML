There are five stages in KDD. (Knowledge Discovery Databases)
1. Selection:
    - In this step, selection and integration of the target data from possibly many different and heterogeneous sources is performed. Then the correct subset of variables and data samples relevant to the analysis task is retrieved from the database.

2. Preprocessing
    - Collecting required data or information to model
    - Outlier treatment or removal of noise
    - Using prior domain knowledge to remove the inconsistencies and duplicates from the data
    - Choice of strategies for handling missing data
    
3. Transformation: 
    - In this step, data is transformed or consolidated into forms appropriate for mining
    - Smoothing (binning, clustering, regression, etc.)
    
4. Data Mining: 
    - In this step, machine learning algorithms are applied to extract data patterns.
    - Exploration/summarization methods such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation and graphical techniques of low-dimensional plots can be used to understand the data.
    - Predictive models such as classification or regression can be used to predict the event or future value

5. Interpretation / Evaluation: 
    - This step is focused on interpreting the mined patterns to make them understandable by the user, such as summarization and visualization
