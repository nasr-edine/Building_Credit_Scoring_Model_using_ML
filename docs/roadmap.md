The main steps to accomplish this data science project are:

1. Understanding the business problem: 
    - Gather a deep understanding of the problem, including the problem statement and the business requirements.

2. Data collection and cleaning: 
    - Acquire the data and clean it to ensure it is ready for analysis.

3. Exploratory data analysis: 
    - Perform an exploratory analysis to better understand the data, identify patterns and trends, and identify potential issues and problems.

4. Feature engineering: 
    - Create new features or transform existing ones to create variables that may better predict the target variable.

5. Model selection and tuning: 
    - Choose the best model to use based on the requirements and use techniques like cross-validation to fine-tune the parameters.

6. Model evaluation: 
    - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and make improvements if necessary.

7. Model interpretation and visualization: 
    - Explain the model results and make them easy to understand for the stakeholders by creating visualizations and summaries.


8. Deployment: 
    - Deploy the model into production and monitor it over time to ensure it is working correctly and providing value.

9. Presentation: 
    - Create a presentation to communicate your results to stakeholders and make recommendations for next steps.

10. Documentation: 
    - Document all aspects of the project to make it easier for others to understand and reproduce your work.
