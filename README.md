![Alt Text](https://github.com/nasr-edine/Building_Credit_Scoring_Model_using_ML/blob/main/imgs/credit_score.jpeg)


Welcome to the repository for the loan scoring algorithm project for the financial institution "Prêt à dépenser". This project focuses on developing a loan scoring algorithm that calculates the probability of loan repayment by a client and classifies loan applications as approved or rejected.

The code has been published on February 6, 2023.

## Prerequisites

- Python interpreter, version 3.7 or higher

## Installation

clone repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasr-edine/project4_build_a_scoring_model.git
```

Navigate to the root directory::

```bash
cd project4_build_a_scoring_model/
```

[set up a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment).

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

[activate it](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment)

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

[install the packages listed in requirements.txt](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-requirements-files)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
